# Embedded Programming - MSP430FR2355

## Introduction

The [MSP430FR2355 launchpad](https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/detail/texas-instruments/MSP-EXP430FR2355/9491427) board contains a 16-bit MCU with 16 registers (20-bits wide) and follows a RISC architecture. 

This repository is based on [Digital Logic & Programming](https://www.youtube.com/@digitallogicprogramming2199)'s [Intro to Embedded Systems Design w/ MSP430FR2355 (textbook videos)](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL643xA3Ie_EuHoNV7AgvJXq-z1hrE8vsm&si=hKogXtpI5A4h_yfR) playlist. 

The scripts here were developed in [Code Composer Studio v.10](https://www.ti.com/tool/download/CCSTUDIO/10.0.0.00010) and goes over the different addressing modes, individual instruction sets, program flow instructions, digital I/Os, interrupts and various serial interfaces present on the board.
